                <p> I’m a young enthusiast looking for a crucible of sorts--a challenging, real-life environment where I can learn the ropes with some experienced folks while exercising my vision in a meaningful way.</br></br>

                This is an opportunity for me to turn my hobby into a profession and use my skills to contribute to something meaningful. </br></br>

                This could be "it."</br></br>

                Now, I don't quite fit your guidelines and am more interested in the learning-experience aspect of the job, but I wouldn't have applied if I didn't think I would be a good (if not the best) candidate to fill the spot.</br></br>

                I like to do things right. An unrelenting drive to improve and a tenacious eye for aesthetic detail have yielded a belief that every aspect of design should be deliberate and considered. Coupled with my near-obsessive approach to "getting it right", this conviction drives me to perpetually seek improvement and self-betterment in my work.</br></br>
                
                I really and truly believe that I can help the SN&R team put even better papers out every week.</br></br>

                I don't have a degree, but I do have the know-how to slap ads around like no one's business. I'm familiar with the tech and comfortable with iterating through layouts to accommodate new demands.

                This is something I can do very well, and you're probably the only place I can find work in this town that would properly take advantage of the bundle of skill and passion that is Ravenstorm.

                <h1>“When you hear the word "deadline," </br> what thought comes to mind?”</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="text container">
                <p>In my senior year of high school, I signed up for Journalism. </br></br>

                The class put out a paper on a monthly basis--a small order, realistically. To add to the simplicity, there was a series of well-spaced deadlines along the way to make sure everyone had plenty of time to write, edit, and submit the content for placement.</br></br>

                According to the schedule, we'd sign up for one or two articles the first week, work on them for a couple more weeks, and then we'd submit content to the editors for placement at the end of the month so that the files could be sent to the printer that worked with the school. </br></br>

                It was a simple process that gave everyone lots of time to do what they needed, but that was definitively not how the class worked out.</br></br>

                Most signed up on time, but few finished with similar punctuality. Most turned their articles in past the submission deadline, and some even <i>wrote</i> theirs after the day of the deadline.</br></br>

                Most of the class didn't seem to know or care that there was a final, undeclared deadline every month--the printer's deadline. If we didn’t sign up on time according to the schedule it was inconsequential, but if we missed that final deadline, an entire issue would never make it to print. </br></br>

                Every single month, toward that last, looming date, I would stay after school (past midnight on some occasions) performing "editorial duties" with the handful of other dedicated student editors. In description, our job was to place our classmates' content into our layouts.</br></br>

                In practice, it was frantic, caffeine-fueled madness. We'd most often spend the time tweaking to our layouts and typing up fluff articles to compensate for all the empty space so we could turn <i>something</i> in to the printers' the following morning.</br></br>

                Despite the pressure and time commitment, work nights were a blast. The class itself never taught me much about journalism, but those monthly production crams certainly taught me things that one just can't pick up from a packet or PowerPoint. </br></br>

                They taught me "soft skills" like time management, common-sense design practices, and effective collaboration with others as well as a set of hard skills--the ability to work in Creative Suite programs like InDesign and Photoshop.</p>

                This question seems to mandate a shorter answer, so I'll keep it brief.</br></br>
                In Journalism, I picked up the beginnings of a valuable skillset that jives amazingly well with the job requirements. InDesign was what I used to set type and create layouts, while Photoshop was mostly used to help pictures look their best in print.</br></br>

                Our school blew a bunch of money on a bank of Mac workstations that year, so I learned to do all of those things on OS X. </br></br>

                Bonus, I've spent hundreds of hours creating and fooling around with Creative Suite since. I'm fairly sure can do this job.

                <h1>“What would you like us to know </br> about you that we won't learn from </br> your resume?”</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="text container">
                <p>I'm a good-humored, quiet kid from a working-class family that was very poor for a very long time. My dad was disabled in an assembly line accident when I was four, and for most of my life, we've been moving from place to place trying to make ends meet. That being what it is, my parents couldn't exactly afford to stash away money for my education. </br></br>

                I want to be educated, though. I'm fascinated with the world and want to put myself in a position where I can contribute something meaningful to it. I value education in the utmost, and want to attend a university but just don't want to do it with debt hanging over my head. I also don't want to have to choose what I study with making money in mind--I want to learn for learning's sake.</br></br>

                My original plan was to hit community college, then transfer to a four-year. The experience was labor-of-Sisyphus-tier absurd. I was going into debt to buy books I would never open for classes I was only taking because I was unable to take the classes I actually wanted, ones I needed to transfer out in two years. </br></br>

                I dropped out partway into my second semester. I wasn't failing or anything, it just felt drawn-out and directionless. I didn't know what I wanted to do and didn't identify with the experience.</br></br>

                With my family's support, I've had the opportunity to set my priorities straight, and have decided to pursue a career in design and development. It'd really be more than a career, though, since it's something I feel strongly about and would like to do every day for the rest of my life.</br></br>

                I love web design, and have taught myself to code in several languages to accommodate my vision. This site isn't a tumblr or a wordpress. I hand-coded it two days ago and edited the text last night.</br></br>

                I'm currently looking for a job so I can send myself to coding bootcamp before next summer. The camp is a three-month-long intensive study program that will train me as a developer--an experience that will give me the tools to make the web a better place and perhaps start my own company or studio.</br></br>
